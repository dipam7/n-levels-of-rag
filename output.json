    "question": "What aspect of performance returns did the author not understand as a child?",
    "answer": "superlinear returns for performance",
    "chunk": "One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance are superlinear."
  },
  {
    "question": "What misconception about returns were teachers and coaches implicitly conveying?",
    "answer": "They were implying that returns are linear, stating that you get out what you put in.",
    "chunk": "Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the phenomenon of superlinear returns for performance and where is it observed?",
    "answer": "Superlinear returns for performance refer to the pattern where the rich get richer and is observed in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and benefit to humanity.",
    "chunk": "It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer."

  {
    "question": "What concept is crucial for understanding the world and experiencing exponential growth in success?",
    "answer": "Superlinear returns",
    "chunk": "You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two fundamental causes that lead to situations with superlinear returns?",
    "answer": "Exponential growth and thresholds.",
    "chunk": "It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is working on growing bacterial cultures an example of superlinear returns?",
    "answer": "The difference in outcome between someone adept at growing bacterial cultures and someone who is not is very great due to the exponential growth pattern of bacterial cultures.",
    "chunk": "The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great."

  {
    "question": "What tends to happen to companies with high growth rates in startups?",
    "answer": "Companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable.",
    "chunk": "Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive."

  {
    "question": "Why does Y Combinator encourage founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers?",
    "answer": "To prevent them from being discouraged early on when the absolute numbers are still low and to help them decide what to focus on using growth rate as a compass.",
    "chunk": "Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially."
  },
  {
    "question": "If growth rate were proportional to performance, what would be the reward for performance p over time t?",
    "answer": "The reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt.",
    "chunk": "YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt."

  {
    "question": "Why does the author find the sentence startling even after decades of thinking about it?",
    "answer": "The author finds the sentence startling due to its profound impact and thought-provoking nature that continues to intrigue them over time.",
    "chunk": "Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling."
