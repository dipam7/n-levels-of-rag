{"question":"What enables individuals to easily generate startup ideas according to the text?","answer":"Being skilled in technology allows individuals to identify missing elements in technology and opportunities to address broken aspects using technology, leading to the generation of startup ideas.","chunk":"Actually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology. Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and each one of these is a potential startup.","chunk_id":"64135aeb363911fea8510bbea00a38fe"}

{"question":"What examples are mentioned in the text where superlinear returns for performance are observed?","answer":"Fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and benefit to humanity.","chunk":"It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.","chunk_id":"7328e00298d2c1298c2e73bc1bf27c65"}

{"question":"What does the text suggest about the origin of successful startups like Apple, Google, and Facebook?","answer":"The text suggests that successful startups like Apple, Google, and Facebook often grow out of projects that were not initially meant to be startups, emphasizing the importance of following one's instincts and exploring what is interesting rather than intentionally trying to start a company.","chunk":"It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of projects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to start a company. You're just following your instincts about what's interesting. And if you're young and good at technology, then your unconscious instincts about what's interesting are better than your conscious ideas about what would be a good company.","chunk_id":"67cc7dca1c73fd07fc61ef1bca564baf"}
{"question":"What is an example of superlinear returns mentioned in the text?","answer":"Working on something that grows exponentially, like growing bacterial cultures.","chunk":"The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.","chunk_id":"03c9013702d3b30ffe3d48073bf40d99"}
{"question":"What is the recommended approach to getting good at technology according to the text?","answer":"The recommended approach is to work on your own projects based on your interests.","chunk":"How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much harder on something you're interested in than something you're doing because you think you're supposed to.","chunk_id":"3bb3e61a043cd396acc7669d021ab532"}
{"question":"According to the text, how can you find cofounders for a startup?","answer":"You can find cofounders by working on projects with them to assess their skills and compatibility.","chunk":"Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders. The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going to say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is someone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and the only way to judge this is to work with them on things.","chunk_id":"305778c59d3ef94fa4db9f28c43f55fd"}
{"question":"How does the text suggest one can grow their territory exponentially?","answer":"The text suggests that one can grow their territory exponentially through conquest, as controlling more territory strengthens the army and makes it easier to conquer new land.","chunk":"Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much.

{"question":"What is the suggested approach in the text for avoiding the drawbacks of a job while still working hard?","answer":"The text suggests that starting your own company is the approach to avoid the drawbacks of a job while still working hard.","chunk":"The trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for avoiding work, because if you start your own company you'll work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including a boss telling you what to do.","chunk_id":"ddd2c319f6b2bae1f9583b497bc615e4"}
{"question":"How did Apple transition from being a project to a company?","answer":"Apple transitioned from being a project to a company when Steve Jobs proposed selling plans for the computer that Steve Wozniak had built, turning their venture into a business.","chunk":"Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also began as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company when Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this computer to other people.\" That's how Apple started. They weren't even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine how lame this company seemed?","chunk_id":"eb3d178c5b1595e38d04de39d1a1de54"}
{"question":"What is the reason for the lack of customs related to exponential growth according to the text?","answer":"The lack of customs related to exponential growth is attributed to the limited instances of it in human history.","chunk":"What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.","chunk_id":"df602c06b072a9ee919034b1903bad01"}
{"question":"What is suggested as the driving force behind more good startups coming out of prestigious universities like MIT or Cambridge?","answer":"The difficulty of getting in, which attracts smart and determined individuals to these institutions.","chunk":"I don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's because the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage to get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart and determined people.","chunk_id":"b81f04934b6ca5bfd56be4f44fcaee9a"}
{"question":"What misconception do teachers and coaches often convey about the relationship between effort and success?","answer":"Teachers and coaches often convey the misconception that the returns are linear, meaning you get out what you put in. However, this is rarely true in reality.","chunk":"Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.","chunk_id":"a9e8cdfb42e07e3fafbce6b69e79ed53"}
{"question":"What activities are considered technology according to the text?","answer":"Practically everything described using the words \"make\" or \"build,\" including welding, making clothes, and making videos.","chunk":"You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them? That's the cutoff.","chunk_id":"7158d40157d16f1c2c96f0d7fe8104f4"}
{"question":"What are the key steps to take in order to start a startup according to the text?","answer":"To start a startup, one needs to get good at technology by working on their own projects and do well in school to get into a good university where cofounders and ideas are found.","chunk":"So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university, because that's where the cofounders and the ideas are.","chunk_id":"f07ccedb98fa171dde6f29af7346f261"}
{"question":"Why does the text suggest doing well in classes and aiming for admission to a top university if you want to start a startup?","answer":"The text suggests doing well in classes and aiming for admission to a top university if you want to start a startup because it is essential to get into a good university to access the best cofounders and employees. Larry and Sergey hired smart individuals from Stanford when they started Google, leading to a significant advantage for the company.","chunk":"At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them.","chunk_id":"bd9da83d7d9b078854442d208ac2de3d"}
{"question":"What solution does a carpenter suggest for the shop's door that is hard to close?","answer":"Plane off the part of the door that sticks.","chunk":"In the town near our house there's a shop with a sign warning that the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put up a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at this situation would think \"why don't you just plane off the part that sticks?\"","chunk_id":"cb780355c90edb1fd4f57990a995d7cf"}
{"question":"What was the most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times according to the text?","answer":"The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was likely scholarship, where the more knowledge one had, the easier it was to learn new things.","chunk":"The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.","chunk_id":"7a4ce1b65d7b83161dc40313b80ad9e2"}
{"question":"What advice does the text provide regarding the type of projects to work on, especially at a young age?","answer":"The text advises building projects that are exciting and can be as frivolous as desired, focusing on creating things that the builder and their friends enjoy, particularly during the teenage years to prepare for starting a startup in the future.","chunk":"Don't feel like your projects have to be serious. They can be as frivolous as you like, so long as you're building things you're excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build the kind of things they and their friends want. And that's exactly what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one day.","chunk_id":"34d05a90a811fafb4ad85ba988d56e93"}
{"question":"What does the text suggest about the relationship between successful startups and the universities their founders attended?","answer":"The text suggests that there is a strong correlation between successful startups and the most selective universities where the founders studied.","chunk":"The empirical evidence is clear on this.

{"question":"What are the outcomes for companies with high growth rates compared to those with lower growth rates in startups?","answer":"Companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.","chunk":"Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.","chunk_id":"26d677b5e3cd7db5e1971408839d0b65"}
{"question":"What is the biggest mistake young founders make, according to the text?","answer":"The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people.","chunk":"So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use — something your friends aren't just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down — then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.","chunk_id":"1411f3d714d808f16a1f58197234c18d"}
{"question":"How can one generate startup ideas even if they excel in a specific technology like programming?","answer":"One can generate startup ideas by looking for problems to solve, exploring personal interests, observing inefficiencies in existing products or services, and seeking inspiration from everyday experiences. It is important to constantly be curious and open to new possibilities.","chunk":"Let's suppose you're 22 and you've succeeded: You're now really good at some technology. How do you get startup ideas? It might seem like that's the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer, how do you get the idea to start Google?","chunk_id":"be4b84b5f53cbd8c3763dce1700bef77"}
{"question":"What startup is referred to in the text that is associated with the term 'facebooks'?","answer":"Facebook","chunk":"Once you're good at programming, all the missing software in the world starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter. I'll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century, American universities used to publish printed directories with all the students' names and contact info. When I tell you what these directories were called, you'll know which startup I'm talking about. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture of each student next to their name.","chunk_id":"534a02393cb614c450e125c66a896997"}
{"question":"According to the text, how do most of the richest people become wealthy?","answer":"Most of the richest people become wealthy by starting their own companies.","chunk":"It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's.

If you look at the lists of the richest people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of them did it by starting their own companies.","chunk_id":"de494946e19340c348b991e5845cd8c4"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is a more effective way to learn programming?","answer":"Working on personal projects and solving problems through practical application is a faster way to learn programming than traditional classroom learning.","chunk":"If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're writing a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you don't know how. You're going to figure out how a lot faster than you'd learn anything in a class.","chunk_id":"51f84c57fa08bbd99b5004731274be79"}
{"question":"Why do tech companies require coding tests from job applicants?","answer":"Tech companies require coding tests from job applicants because they believe grades and exam results do not necessarily prove one's programming skills. They want to assess the candidate's actual coding abilities, which may not be accurately reflected by academic performance alone.","chunk":"Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing.","chunk_id":"1db1f51732c41c249f1e5297d0b66acb"}

Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000 startups.","chunk":"The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups when they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000 startups.

{"question":"How did Steve Jobs' teenage interest in calligraphy influence Apple's success in graphic design?","answer":"Steve Jobs' teenage interest in calligraphy influenced Apple's success in graphic design by shaping the design of the Macintosh computer, which featured beautiful, printed-book-like letters that stood out in the computer industry.","chunk":"Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design.","chunk_id":"980edb7442a1c0b4847d9c01d2d087a6"}

It suggests that by taking the necessary steps, a company can have as much chance of success as Google did.","chunk":"All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it seems worth pursuing. You can't know whether it will turn into a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I say I'm going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I'm going to tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google.","chunk_id":"965e5abc2b1409f099518c51d13d7a5a"}
{"question":"According to Y Combinator, why do they encourage founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers?","answer":"Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers to prevent early discouragement, guide their focus, and achieve exponential growth.","chunk":"Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.","chunk_id":"1a7ffb66eee2c0776a951b980216c488"}

Universities are crucial for finding cofounders because they are where ideas are generated from collaborations with future cofounders.","chunk":"You don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university. The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders.","chunk_id":"708d5f638252ac76efe52388ffb7df2e"}
{"question":"What motivated Larry and Sergey to work on improving search results before founding Google?","answer":"Larry and Sergey were motivated to work on improving search results because they noticed that most search engines at that time didn't prioritize search results by importance.","chunk":"Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave you every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\" Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like Mark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this is stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let's figure out which those are and show them first.\"","chunk_id":"170c43d3e296cbbd3f6fe0d1279e9e10"}
{"question":"What situation at Harvard University prompted Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook?","answer":"The lack of a centralized online platform for the whole university, despite individual house Facebooks being present, prompted Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook.","chunk":"So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university still hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has an online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university. The university administration has been diligently having meetings about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another decade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this situation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a program to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\" So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of users.","chunk_id":"89e2387b62ad20b76b1af5196c84160d"}
